        The great hurdle of making the breakthrough into security has been overcome. 
        It took many long nights and early mornings, studying and investing in myself 
        to gain the nesscarry skills needed to add value to an employer.        
      </p>
       
      <p>
        This article however is about, “Now what?”. 
        Where am I going next with my career? Well when I approach any questions 
        about the future I ask myself, “What does good look like?”.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>What is the end goal in 5 years?</strong></h3>
      <p>
        To be able to help companies secure their infrastructure to the 
        best standards and have my input be taken with high regard. 
        To have influence to help other aspiring Information Security 
        professionals break into the field by having a say in the 
        hiring process. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5><strong>Breakdown</strong></h5>

      <ol>
        <li>Be Security Ninja.</li>
        <li>Have influence within my company.</li>
        <li>Help aspiring InfoSec candiates accomplish their goal.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Now let me break it down each goal.</p>
      <br>

      <h5><strong>Become a Security Ninja</strong></h5>

      <!-- SECURITY NINJA IMAGE -->
      <img src="images/Securitynija.png" alt="Security Ninja" style="width: 50%;">

      <p>How I see it, there are core knowledge points when it comes to InfoSec.</p>

      <div class="w3">
        <ul>
          <li>Networking</li>
          <li>Linux</li>
          <li>Windows</li>
          <li>Programming</li>
          <li>Exploitation</li>
          <li>Defense</li>
          <li>Security Standards (NIST,ISO,CIS)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      

      <p>I plan on investing time, energy, and money in books, 
        courses, and personal projects to learn these skills.
      </p>

      <!-- Second Part -->

      <h5><strong>Have influence in my organization</strong></h5>

      <p>
        One of the things I love about working in Tech is the sense 
        of impact you have on the success of our company. For example 
        taking down a Domain Controller in the network, may cause your 
        co-workers to not be able to login into their devices
        potentially losing large amounts of profits.
      </p>

       <p>
        This understanding that the decisions I make during work 
        have a great impact to many of my co-workers and some who 
        I call my friends, gives me a deep sense of purpose and 
        meaning. I take my work serious and thus would like an 
        impact on the decisions being made at my company.
       </p>

       <p>
        I want to become the guy in the room who is always conscious of the 1st, 
        2nd, and 3rd consequences of each action. This takes having a deep 
        understanding of how the infrastructre is configured and why. 
        It also takes being aware of any changes happening to the infratructure 
        and asking the right questions.
       </p>

       <p>
        I want to become the person my director can reliably depend on and 
        look to, to make sure things run smoothly. This takes time and takes 
        proactivly looking to improve processes. I do feel I need to be aware
        of my limitations and not accept respondsibilities I'm not ready for.
       </p>

       <p>
        I want become a leader in my organzation. I want to be a leader who leads 
        by example and knows how to motivate the those around them to exceed 
        their potential.
       </p>

       <p>
        By doing the above I feel having influence will come nataurally. 
       </p>
       <br>
       
       <h5><strong>Help aspiring InfoSec professionals accomplish their goal</strong></h5>

      
       <p>
        There’s so many things to learn in this space. I know I am just starting 
        out so I don’t have much to offer, but I promise I will never close the 
        door on anyone who asks for help. If there is any actual value I can add, 
        I will.
