        The great hurdle of making the breakthrough into security has been overcome. 
        It took many long nights and early mornings, studying and investing in myself 
        to gain the nesscarry skills needed to add value to an employer.        
      </p>
       
      <p>
        This article however is about, “Now what?”. 
        Where am I going next with my career? Well when I approach any questions 
        about the future I ask myself, “What does good look like?”.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>What is the end goal in 5 years?</strong></h3>
      <p>
        To be able to help companies secure their infrastructure to the 
        best standards and have my input be taken with high regard. 
        To have influence to help other aspiring Information Security 
        professionals break into the field by having a say in the 
        hiring process. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5><strong>Breakdown</strong></h5>

      <ol>
        <li>Be Security Ninja.</li>
        <li>Have influence within my company.</li>
        <li>Help aspiring InfoSec candiates accomplish their goal.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Now let me break it down each goal.</p>
      <br>

      <h5><strong>Become a Security Ninja</strong></h5>

      <!-- SECURITY NINJA IMAGE -->

      <p>How I see it, there are core knowledge points when it comes to InfoSec.</p>

      <div class="w3">
        <ul>
          <li>Networking</li>
          <li>Linux</li>
          <li>Windows</li>
          <li>Programming</li>
          <li>Exploitation</li>
          <li>Defense</li>
          <li>Security Standards (NIST,ISO,CIS)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      

      <p>I plan on investing time, energy, and money in books, 
        courses, and personal projects to learn these skills.
      </p>

      <h5><strong>Have influence in my organization</strong></h5>

      <p>
        One of the things I love about working in Tech is the sense 
        of impact you have on the success of our company. For example 
        taking down a Domain Controller in the network, may cause your 
        co-workers to not be able to login into their devices
        potentially losing large amounts of profits.
      </p>

      <p>
        While working as a NOC analyst for some time, our main focus 
        was to maintian Availibilty. Availbiity is only one of the 
        principles of the CIA Triangle.
      </p>

      <!-- ENTER PICTURE OF CIA TRIANGLE -->

      <!-- 
        Confiedntity – ensuring only the people who are meant to view company data are the only ones with access to those files.

Integrity – ensuring data is not currupted by adverseries internally or externally

Availibilty – Ensure to maintaing the infrasturcutre has fault tolerance and no single points of failures

       -->


       <p>
        This understanding that the decisions I make during work 
        have a great impact to many of my co-workers and some who 
        I call my friends, gives me a deep sense of purpose and 
        meaning. I take my work serious and thus would like an 
        impact on the decisions being made at my company.
       </p>
